## Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on securely connecting to your Linux server. This guide is tailored for beginners, providing step-by-step instructions and insights to enhance your server's security using SSH. Also, some basic knowledge I picked up doing research on Backups, including popular tools and routines, as well as basic knowledge on 

## Understanding SSH

### Before You Dive In

Before making any changes to your SSH configuration, it's crucial to proceed with caution. Consider having a second terminal session open to your server as a safety net, preventing potential lockouts during the process.

### Unlocking the Power of SSH Keys

#### Why Opt for SSH Keys?

Embracing SSH keys offers a significant boost in security and user convenience compared to traditional passwords. This cryptographic pair, consisting of a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption, forms the backbone of secure SSH connections.

#### How SSH Keys Work

SSH keys operate based on a public-private key pair. The public key encrypts data, while the private key decrypts it. During the connection process, the server encrypts a challenge message using the public key, and the client decrypts it with the private key, establishing a secure connection.

### Generating Your SSH Keys

#### Objectives

- Create robust Ed25519 SSH keys for authentication.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Open your local machine's terminal and execute the following command to generate Ed25519 keys:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519
    ```

    Follow the prompts to determine where to save the keys. The private key remains on your local machine, while the public key is appended to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the server.

#### Additional Tips

- Consider using `ssh-copy-id` for secure and efficient key transfer.
- Explore passphrases for added security, keeping your private key safe.

### Implementing Secure 2FA/MFA

Enhance your server's security by implementing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) or Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) specifically for SSH access.

#### Why Consider 2FA/MFA?

While SSH provides a robust security layer, adding an extra authentication factor, such as a time-based token, significantly strengthens your defense against unauthorized access.

#### How to Implement 2FA/MFA

1. Install the `libpam-google-authenticator` module:

    On Debian-based systems:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator
    ```

2. Run `google-authenticator` for the user you want to enable 2FA/MFA:

    ```bash
    google-authenticator
    ```

    Follow the prompts to set up the authentication token.

3. Modify the PAM configuration for SSH (`/etc/pam.d/sshd`) to include:

    ```bash
    auth       required     pam_google_authenticator.so nullok
    ```

4. Update `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to enable Challenge-Response Authentication:

    ```bash
    ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
    ```

5. Restart the SSH service:

    ```bash
    sudo service ssh restart
    ```

## Backups: Popular Tools and Policies/Routines

### Introduction-1

This README explores fundamental aspects of data backups, covering popular tools and essential practices to safeguard your valuable information.

### Popular Backup Tools

#### rsync

[Rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) is a versatile command-line tool for efficient file synchronization. It simplifies copying and updating files by transmitting only the differences between the source and destination.

#### Duplicity

[Duplicity](http://duplicity.nongnu.org/) combines the power of the rsync algorithm with encryption. It supports various storage options, making it a reliable choice for securing your data.

#### BackupPC

[BackupPC](http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/) is a high-performance system designed for backing up PCs to a server's disk. It features a user-friendly web interface and supports essential features like pooling, compression, and full/incremental backups.

#### Backups Tutorial

**Simple Backup Tutorial: Using rsync**

1. Open a terminal on your local machine.

2. Use the following command to perform a simple backup using rsync:

    ```bash
    rsync -avz /path/to/source/ user@remote_server:/path/to/destination/
    ```

    This command syncs the source directory to the destination directory on the remote server.

3. Monitor the progress and ensure the backup completes successfully.

#### Backup Policies Tutorial

**Setting Up Retention Policies**

1. Determine your retention requirements, e.g., daily, weekly, and monthly backups.

2. Use a tool like BackupPC to configure retention policies based on your requirements.

3. Regularly review and adjust retention policies to balance data preservation and storage efficiency.

#### Backup Routines Tutorial

**Automating Regular Backups with cron**

1. Open your server's crontab configuration:

    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```

2. Add a cron job entry for your backup routine. For example, to run a backup every day at 3 AM:

    ```bash
    0 3 * * * rsync -avz /path/to/source/ /path/to/backup/
    ```

    Save and exit the crontab editor.

### Introduction-2

This section covers common tasks to enhance the security of your UNIX server. Implementing these measures contributes to a robust defense against potential threats.

## System Security: Common Tasks to Harden a UNIX Server

### Update and Patch Regularly

Regularly updating and patching your server's operating system and installed software is crucial for addressing security vulnerabilities. Utilize package managers to streamline the update process.

**Updating Your System with apt (Debian/Ubuntu)**

1. Open a terminal.

2. Run the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to install updates.

### Firewall Configuration

Configure a firewall to control incoming and outgoing network traffic. Tools like `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) simplify firewall management for users who may not be familiar with complex iptables rules.

**Configuring Firewall with ufw**

1. Install ufw (if not installed):

    ```bash
    sudo apt install ufw
    ```

2. Enable ufw:

    ```bash
    sudo ufw enable
    ```

3. Allow necessary services, e.g., SSH:

    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
    ```

### User Account Management

Practicing secure user account management involves regularly reviewing and managing user access. Remove unnecessary accounts, enforce strong password policies, and consider implementing periodic access reviews.

**Managing User Accounts with userdel**

1. Open a terminal.

2. Run the following command to delete a user:

    ```bash
    sudo userdel -r username
    ```

    Replace "username" with the actual username.

### Simple Security Measures

Implement simple security measures like disabling unnecessary services, restricting unnecessary access, and regularly auditing system logs for unusual activities.

**Disabling Unnecessary Services**

1. Identify unnecessary services:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=service
    ```

2. Disable a service:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl disable servicename
    ```

    Replace "servicename" with the actual service name.
